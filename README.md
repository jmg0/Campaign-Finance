# Campaign Finance

The goal of this project is to perform a wholesome analysis of campaign contributions to the major candidates in the 2020 Presidential Election. Once data analysis is completed, the project will transition to GIS software to display the results. Details are below.

Campaign contributions are not always straightforward. Depending on the origin, intent, amount, and intermediary stops, not all contributions have to be reported with details about the contributor or amount. For example, all individual contributions have to be logged by the receiving committee, but only those individual contributions greater than $200.00 have to be reported to the FEC in detail. Reporting contributions in detail to the FEC requires that the receiving committee record the name, address, occupation, and employer, among other things, of the contributor. These qualifying individual contributions must be itemized and reported with the required information about the contributor.
